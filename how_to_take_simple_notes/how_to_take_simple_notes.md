# How to Take Smart Notes
## One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking

### 1. Everything You Need to Know

Planning to learn, that is, setting up a rigid structure for when you will study and think is, in the long-run, doomed to failure.  While it's certainly proven to work for short-term goals, such as studying for an exam, you are likely to abandon that structure once your goal is achieved.  “I never force myself to do anything I don’t feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else.” says ... .  That being said, you do need a system, some structure to ensure that your learning generates insight and ideas.  "It is a huge misunderstanding that the only alternative to planning is aimless messing around. The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward".  A succesfull structure enables flow, which is descibed as "the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975)."  This system should be a way of keeping track of the things you learn, and the ides you generate, combined in an intelligent way.

### 1.1. Good Solutions are Simple - and Unexpected

"The best way to deal with complexity is to keep things as simple as possible".  Traditional systems for note taking are often seperated by topics and sub-topics, which on the whole seems simple and sensible, but it's easy for a system such as this to quickly grow in complexity the more heading that are applied.  "[M]ost distractions do not come so much from our environment, but our own minds", with a trusted system, one that takes care of everything, your brain can enter "mind like water", a state of deep focus where competing thoughts fail to distract us from the task at hand.  "Routines requires simple, repeatable tasks that can become automatic and fit together seamlessly (cf Mata, Todd, and Lippke, 2010)"

... 's system required keeping two slip-boxes, the first, a bibliographical box, which contained cards, on one side a reference and on the other a breif note on the content of the literature.  The second box, the main one, was for more detailed notes and ideas.

"We need a reliable and simple external stucture to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains."
